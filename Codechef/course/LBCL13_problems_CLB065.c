// Parentheses
// Let us take a look at the code from last problem.

// int age = 25;
// int voting_age = 18;

// if (age >= voting_age) {
//     printf("Old enough to vote!");
// } else {
//     printf("Not old enough to vote.");
// }
// To things to note here:

// The condition age >= voting_age is inside parentheses ( ).
// The printf statements are inside curly brackets { }.
// The parentheses are mandatory after if statement, and the condition comes inside them. We use curly brackets in C to define scope. Because of the curly braces, C knows that it has to execute the print statement if the condition becomes true.

// Task
// You need to do the following

// Run the code as is and read the error that you get
// Add parentheses around the condition and then re-run the code

//ANS

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int age = 25;
    int voting_age = 18;
    
    if (age >= voting_age) {
        printf("Old enough to vote!\n");
    } else {
        printf("Not old enough to vote.");
        printf("Wait for %d years", voting_age - age);
    }
}
