// Test cases with multiple types of input
// In the previous problem, each testcase had 2 lines of input - each consisting of integers.
// Test cases can also contain a combination of integers and strings.

// Task
// Let's write a program in the IDE which performs the following

// The 1st line of input contains t - the count of testcases
// Each testcase consists of the following 2 lines of input
// The 1st line of the testcase contains 2 integers - accept them as variables A and B
// The 2nd line of the testcase contains 1 string - accept it as a variable S
// For each test case, output on one line the 2 integers followed by the string

//ANS
