// Test cases with multiple lines of input
// In the previous problem, we had t test cases and each test case had 1 line of input.
// However, each test case can have multiple lines of input as well.

// Task
// Let's write a program in the IDE which performs the following

// The 1st line of input is an integer t - the count of test cases
// Each test case consists of 2 lines of input
// The 1st line of input has 2 space separated integers - accept them as variables A and B
// The 2nd line of input has 3 space separated integers - accept them as variables C, D and E
// For each test case - output all integers on a single line/

//ANS

int main() {
    int t;
    int A,B,C,D,E;
    int i = 1;

    while ( i <= t) {
        scanf("%d %d", &A, &B );
        scanf("%d %d %d", &C, &D, &E );
